# Desky: Revolutionizing Private Bidding for Moroccan Startups

In today's competitive landscape, new startups often struggle to find markets for their products or services. Recognizing this challenge. As a revolutionary Private Call for Bids Web App (MVP), also known as "LES Apple d'offre privé Platform" in French, Desky aims to bridge the gap between startups and markets in the Moroccan business landscape.

*But how did this idea take shape? And why do we believe that Desky will change the game in Morocco?*

## Project Status

The project is currently in progress. We are actively developing and refining the features and functionalities of the MVP version.
## Project Idea

First, I’m an intern at a web development bootcamp. We are always building small projects to learn the languages and tools, but we're not building a huge, stunning project that takes months to develop and has the complexity needed to thrive. That's why I always try to develop myself and search for real-life projects to work on. Additionally, I want to work on a project for my end-of-study (projet de fin d'études).

**So, how do I find a great idea?**

ADIL MIFTAH, a Business & Finance Adviser and owner of S.G.G.L SARL, has helped thousands of startups thrive and is also a famous influencer with a huge network. ADIL MIFTAH proposed an idea to me. After hours of discussion, I believed that I would benefit greatly from this project. Thus, a new partnership was formed, and I started working on this project with Adil.

**But why Private Call For Bids?**

Desky targets two types of users and provides help to both:

- **Depositors:** Those who post offers. Desky provides them with a range of companies and auto-entrepreneurs to bid on their projects. To ensure credibility, bidders must register using their company information and can receive reviews on their accounts. This helps depositors get the best in the market.

- **Bidders:** Those who bid on offers. Bidders gain access to market offers to bid on and can also build credibility through reviews, ensuring that their company is reliable.

Adil's extensive network, including friends, companies, and entrepreneurs, will help populate the platform with initial offers. Moreover, his significant social media audience in the business niche will generate leads and interest in the market. Market research has shown there is a huge opportunity for Desky.

**So, what is the first step we start with?**
## Site Map

After several meetings to deeply understand the project idea, I started by building the site map.

The site map outlines the structure and navigation flow of the web application. It includes the main pages and their hierarchical organization to ensure an intuitive user experience.

*Status : In Progress.*

## UML
Next, I developed the UML diagrams.

UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams are crucial for visualizing the system's architecture and design. They provide a clear blueprint of the system's components, their relationships, and interactions, ensuring a cohesive and well-structured application development process.

*Status : Done.*

## UI System

The UI system defines the design components and patterns used throughout the application. It establishes consistency and visual coherence across different pages and screens.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14:** We chose Next.js 14 for its powerful features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized performance, which enhance the overall user experience and SEO.
- **TypeScript:** TypeScript is used to add static typing to our codebase, improving code quality and maintainability by catching errors early in the development process.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is utilized for its utility-first CSS framework, allowing us to build responsive and modern designs quickly and efficiently.
- **SHADCN/UI:** SHADCN/UI provides pre-designed UI components, enabling rapid development and a consistent look and feel across the application.
- **Zustand:** Zustand is used for state management, providing a simple and scalable solution for managing application state.

### Backend
- **Express.js:** We chose Express.js for its minimalistic and flexible framework, which allows us to build robust APIs quickly and efficiently. Its extensive middleware options and simple routing make it an excellent choice for handling the server-side logic of our application.
- **Mongoose:** Mongoose is used for its powerful Object Data Modeling (ODM) capabilities with MongoDB. It simplifies data validation, schema design, and provides a straightforward API for interacting with the database, ensuring our data layer is reliable and easy to maintain.

### Database
- **MongoDB:** We selected MongoDB for its flexibility and scalability as a NoSQL database. Its document-oriented storage model aligns perfectly with our need to handle varying data structures efficiently. MongoDB's robust performance and scalability features ensure that our application can grow and handle increasing loads seamlessly.
## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Bid Invitation Management**: Create, send, and manage bid invitations.
- **Bid Submission**: Allow vendors to submit bids in response to invitations.
- **Bid Evaluation**: Evaluate and compare bids to select the best proposal.
